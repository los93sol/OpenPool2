## Hardware
### Billiards Table
#### Size
The size of the table will determine how much distance you need between the lens of the Azure Kinect and the table top.
**7ft Table:** 4.5ft  
**8ft Table:** 5.25ft  
**9ft Table:** 6ft

#### Cloth Color
Gray or gold cloth is recommended for the best experience.

### Projector
**Recommended:** [UHD35STx](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XVNJNXT?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1)  
The UHD35STx has 4 corner geometric correction which simplifies tightly fitting the image to the edges of the rails.  

You'll need to attach the projector vertically onto the ceiling.  I used [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09P1G3L1D?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) standard ceiling mount.  

**Considerations**
- Throw Ratio
- Brightness
- Latency

### Mini PC
**Recommended:** [KAMRUI CK10](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4J68GHM?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1)

**Minimum Requirements**
- i7 10th Gen CPU (lower should work but has not been tested) 
- DX11 Capable GPU
- Intel USB 3.0 chipset
- 8GB RAM
- Windows 10 or 11 (64 bit)
- Mouse and Keyboard

**Optional**
- Bluetooth/Wifi
- Speaker

### Azure Kinect DK
Can be purchased direct from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/azure-kinect-dk/8pp5vxmd9nhq?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)  

You'll need to mount the camera as well.  I used [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0747F8BWN?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1), but would recommend something with an extension for cable clearance.
